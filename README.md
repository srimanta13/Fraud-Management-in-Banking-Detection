# Problem Statement: PredCatch Analytics' Australian banking client's profitability and reputation are being hit by fraudulent ATM transactions. They want PredCatch to help them in reducing and if possible completely eliminating such fraudulent transactions. PredCatch believes it can do the same by building a predictive model to catch such fraudulent transactions in real time and decline them. Your job as PredCatch's Data Scientist is to build this fraud detection & prevention predictive model in the first step. If successful, in the 2nd step you will have to present your solutions and explain how it works to the client. The data has been made available to you.
